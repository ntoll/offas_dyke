# Offa's Dyke GPX Routes

The GPX files contained within this repository are the daily trails for walking
Offa's Dyke heading in a northerly direction.

Some of them do not completely match the official route as we deviate to walk
to our accomodation. Where this takes place, we ensure we flag the deviations
by naming the file ending with `bespoke.gpx`. We also provide a non `bespoke`
version for the official route.

The files are named as `OffasDyke_Day_N.gpx` where `N` is a number to indicate
the day of the walk.

The trails were based upon those
[found here](https://www.walkoffasdyke.co.uk/offas-dyke-interactive-map-and-route/).

The `itinery.csv` file contains details of the stops, distances and daily
start/end points.
